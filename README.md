# SENSOR COOPER V3.2 - MEDIALAB LPWAN: ULTRASONIC SENSOR FOR MEASURING SAN MIGUEL'S CREEK WATER LEVEL

Project based on: https://github.com/rwanrooy/TTGO-PAXCOUNTER-LoRa32-V2.1-TTN.

- Changes made for JSN-SR04T: ultrasonic distance sensor

- Dynamic Duty Cycle implementation: send interval dynamically changes its value depending on the typical deviation from the latest 5 distances sent to TTN
